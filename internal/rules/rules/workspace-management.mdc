## Workspaces

Workspaces allow multiple instances of Claude Code or other agents to run on the same repository at the same time. Workspaces are just a wrapper around git branches worktrees.

**IMPORTANT:** When working in a workspace, you will be in $HOME/.claude/workspaces/<repo>/<workspace>, make all changes there.

**IMPORTANT:** `agentctl workspace` commands use the underlying git repo so they return and manage workspaces for the current Git repository.

### When I tell you to use a workspace

Use `agentctl workspace` commands to manage workspaces. All workspace commands operate on the current Git repository.

### When I tell you to create a workspace

Run:
```bash
agentctl workspace create <branch-name>
```
This creates a new worktree for the specific branch, creating the branch if it does not already exist.

### When I tell you to show a workspace path

Run:
```bash
agentctl workspace show <branch-name>
```
This shows the absolute path to the workspace.

### When I tell you to list workspaces

Run:
```bash
agentctl workspace list --json
```
This lists all workspaces for the current repository.

### When I tell you to delete a workspace

Run:
```bash
agentctl workspace delete <branch-name>
```
This deletes the workspace by removing the worktree but not the branch.

If the workspace has uncommitted changes and I want to force delete it, run:
```bash
agentctl workspace delete --force <branch-name>
```

### When I tell you to check workspace status

Run:
```bash
agentctl workspace status <branch>
```
This shows detailed status information about the workspace.
