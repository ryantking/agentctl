## Conventional Commits

ALWAYS follow the Conventional Commit Messages specification to generate commit messages WHEN committing to the default branch or merging pull requests:

The commit message should be structured as follows:

```
<type>[optional scope]: <description>

[optional body]

[optional footer(s)]
```

### Commit Types

- **fix**: a commit of the type fix patches a bug in your codebase (this correlates with PATCH in Semantic Versioning).
- **feat**: a commit of the type feat introduces a new feature to your codebase (this correlates with MINOR in Semantic Versioning).
- **BREAKING CHANGE**: a commit that has a footer BREAKING CHANGE:, or appends a ! after the type/scope, introduces a breaking API change (correlating with MAJOR in Semantic Versioning). A BREAKING CHANGE can be part of commits of any type.
- types other than fix: and feat: are allowed, for example @commitlint/config-conventional (based on the Angular convention) recommends build:, chore:, ci:, docs:, style:, refactor:, perf:, test:, and others.
- footers other than BREAKING CHANGE: <description> may be provided and follow a convention similar to git trailer format.
- Additional types are not mandated by the Conventional Commits specification, and have no implicit effect in Semantic Versioning (unless they include a BREAKING CHANGE). A scope may be provided to a commit's type, to provide additional contextual information and is contained within parenthesis, e.g., feat(parser): add ability to parse arrays.

### Conventional Commits Specification

The key words "MUST", "MUST NOT", "REQUIRED", "SHALL", "SHALL NOT", "SHOULD", "SHOULD NOT", "RECOMMENDED", "MAY", and "OPTIONAL" in this document are to be interpreted as described in RFC 2119.

Commits MUST be prefixed with a type, which consists of a noun, feat, fix, etc., followed by the OPTIONAL scope, OPTIONAL !, and REQUIRED terminal colon and space.
The type feat MUST be used when a commit adds a new feature to your application or library.
The type fix MUST be used when a commit represents a bug fix for your application.
A scope MAY be provided after a type. A scope MUST consist of a noun describing a section of the codebase surrounded by parenthesis, e.g., fix(parser):
A description MUST immediately follow the colon and space after the type/scope prefix. The description is a short summary of the code changes, e.g., fix: array parsing issue when multiple spaces were contained in string.
A longer commit body MAY be provided after the short description, providing additional contextual information about the code changes. The body MUST begin one blank line after the description.
A commit body is free-form and MAY consist of any number of newline separated paragraphs.
One or more footers MAY be provided one blank line after the body. Each footer MUST consist of a word token, followed by either a :<space> or <space># separator, followed by a string value (this is inspired by the git trailer convention).
A footer's token MUST use - in place of whitespace characters, e.g., Acked-by (this helps differentiate the footer section from a multi-paragraph body). An exception is made for BREAKING CHANGE, which MAY also be used as a token.
A footer's value MAY contain spaces and newlines, and parsing MUST terminate when the next valid footer token/separator pair is observed.
Breaking changes MUST be indicated in the type/scope prefix of a commit, or as an entry in the footer.
If included as a footer, a breaking change MUST consist of the uppercase text BREAKING CHANGE, followed by a colon, space, and description, e.g., BREAKING CHANGE: environment variables now take precedence over config files.
If included in the type/scope prefix, breaking changes MUST be indicated by a ! immediately before the :. If ! is used, BREAKING CHANGE: MAY be omitted from the footer section, and the commit description SHALL be used to describe the breaking change.
Types other than feat and fix MAY be used in your commit messages, e.g., docs: update ref docs.
The units of information that make up Conventional Commits MUST NOT be treated as case sensitive by implementors, with the exception of BREAKING CHANGE which MUST be uppercase.
BREAKING-CHANGE MUST be synonymous with BREAKING CHANGE, when used as a token in a footer.

## Workflow

### When I tell you to commit changes

**If you're on the default branch (main/master):**
- Check git status to see which changes to commit based on my instructions
- Manually manage the staging area with `git add`
- When dealing with many changes, group related changes into separate commits
- Always use conventional commit format: `<type>(scope): <description>`

**If you're on a feature branch:**
- Expect that commits for new/modified files are added automatically by hooks
- For deletions or user-requested changes, manually commit:
  ```bash
  git add file-to-delete.py
  git commit -m "Remove deprecated file"
  ```
- Use simple, single-line, non-conventional commit messages like "Changed 3 files" or "Deleted 2 files"

### When I tell you to create a branch

- If using a Linear ticket, use the Linear-generated branch name
- Otherwise, use a conventional branch name like `feat/area/some-feature`
- Create the branch: `git checkout -b <branch-name>`

### When I tell you to merge a local branch (without PR)

**IMPORTANT:** Only use this workflow when merging a local branch directly. For pull requests, see "When I tell you to merge a pull request" below.

1. Check `<context-refresh>` for workspace status before merging
2. Ensure you're on the default branch main/master unless I specify otherwise
3. Delete the workspace if it exists:
   ```bash
   agentctl workspace delete <branch-name>
   ```
4. Switch to main and update:
   ```bash
   git checkout main && git pull origin main
   ```
5. Review changes before merging:
   ```bash
   git log main..<branch-name> --oneline
   git diff main...<branch-name> --stat
   ```
6. Squash merge and create conventional commit:
   ```bash
   git merge --squash <branch-name>
   git commit -m "$(cat <<'EOF'
   feat(scope): description of changes

   Detailed explanation of what changed and why.

   - Key change 1
   - Key change 2

   Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
   EOF
   )"
   ```
7. Push and cleanup:
   ```bash
   git push origin main
   git branch -D <branch-name>
   ```
   (Use `-D` not `-d` because squash merges don't create merge references)

### When I tell you to create a pull request

1. Verify auto-commits are present:
   ```bash
   git log -1
   ```
2. Check for any uncommitted changes:
   ```bash
   git status -sb
   ```
3. Analyze the changes and ask me if needed about what to include
4. Push the branch with upstream tracking:
   ```bash
   git push -u origin <branch-name>
   ```
5. Create the PR using gh CLI with conventional commit format:
   - **PR title**: Use conventional commit headline format: `<type>(scope): <description>`
     - Example: `feat(memory): implement memory command tree`
   - **PR body**: Use conventional commit body format (detailed explanation, NOT the headline)
     - Start with detailed explanation of what changed and why
     - Include bullet points for key changes
     - Add footers like `Co-Authored-By:` as needed
     - Body MUST contain actual explanations, not placeholder text
   - **Why**: GitHub squash merge uses PR title + body as the commit message, so format it as a complete conventional commit
   ```bash
   gh pr create --title "feat(scope): description" --body "$(cat <<'EOF'
   Detailed explanation of what changed and why this change matters.
   Describe the reasoning behind the implementation choices.

   - Actual key change 1 with context
   - Actual key change 2 with context
   - Actual key change 3 with context

   Co-Authored-By: Claude <noreply@anthropic.com>
   EOF
   )"
   ```

### When I tell you to merge a pull request

1. Verify PR checks pass:
   ```bash
   gh pr checks <number>
   ```
2. If checks failed, view logs and fix issues:
   ```bash
   gh pr checks <number> --web
   ```
3. If there are review comments, address them and push updates:
   ```bash
   git add <files>
   git commit -m "Address review comments"
   git push
   ```
4. Delete the workspace before merging (if applicable):
   ```bash
   agentctl workspace delete <branch-name>
   ```
5. Merge the pull request:
   - **GitHub is configured** to use PR title + body as the squash merge commit message
   - Since the PR was created with conventional commit format (title = headline, body = commit body), you can merge via GitHub UI or use:
   ```bash
   gh pr merge <number> --squash --delete-branch
   ```
   - No manual commit message crafting needed - GitHub uses the PR title + body automatically
